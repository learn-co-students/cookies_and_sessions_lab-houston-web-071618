# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# corn = Product.create(name: 'Corn')
# cereal = Product.create(name: 'Cereal')
# milk = Product.create(name: 'Milk')
# soda = Product.create(name: 'Soda')
# coco = Product.create(name: 'Coconut Water')
